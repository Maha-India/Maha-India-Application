# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

 **We do not recommend using the versions marked with a :x: as they do not support encryption or have an unresolved security issue.**

| Version | Supported          |

| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For minor vulnerabilities, we suggest you to use the issue tracker template for security vulnerabilities.

For moderate vulnerabilities, please [Email us](mailto:mahaindia360@gmail.com).

For severe vulnerabilities, follow the same procedure as for moderate vulnerabilities, but you must include the contact of a non-profit programmer (who won't charge any fees whatsoever)capable of resolving the vulnerability, given that this application has been created by school student, not professional software developers.
